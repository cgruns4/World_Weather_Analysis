# World_Weather_Analysis
---
The purpose of this analysis was to retrieve weather data from openweather api, so that beta testers could use
this weather information to input specific weather requests in order to map out potential vacation spots.  The
vacation spots were to each meet similar weather criteria.  This information was then used to create a travel
destination map, along with a travel itinerary map.
